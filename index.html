<p>This library would help you to deal with a bunch of Data by making use of statistics, time series analysis, and machine learning. Although such academic domains seem to be difficult for most developers, this library targets ordinary scala developers; as a result, it focus on usability rather than precise definition. Besides, I hope this could be useful for beginners of scala.</p>

<p>
Scalearn runs on spark, which is distributed system like hadoop 
<br>
=> <a href="http://spark.apache.org/">spark</a>
<br>The main difference between them is that spark concentrates on the tasks which need to load Dataset again and again like machine learning algorithms. For such tasks spark runs much faster( at most 100 times roughly speaking ). Therefore, you could carry out machine learning on your distributed system without complicated configuration.</p>

<h4>#Descriptive Statistics</h4>
<br>
<p>If you are interested in statistics, take a look at "datafactory" package since it is what you need to handle. Even compared to the other statistical environment, scala has a variety of simple but powerful functions to process Data; accordingly, you would use Scalearn after processing raw Data somehow through scala's functions. The description below might be the common flow of statistical analysis in Scalearn</p>
<ol>
	<li>get raw Data</li>
	<li>preprocessing the raw Data</li>
	<li>convert that raw Data into instance of "Data class"</li>
	<li>obtain statistical value by calling properties and methods</li>
	<li>( If wanna treat it differently; for instance,  as time series Data, convert it into instance of "TimeData" class )</li>
</ol>

<p>Well, Let's take some examples</p>

<p>First of all, you need to import "datafactory package" and "Converter object"; they allow you to obtain statistical value easily. </p>
	<pre><code>import datafactory._
import Converter._</code></pre>		

<p>and assume you have raw Data already( let me say just "raw" to distinguish with Data instance) </p>	

<pre><code>val raw1:Vector[Double] = Vector(1,2,3,4,5,6)
val raw2 = Vector(1.0,2,3,4,5)
val raw3 = Vector(1,2,3,4,5).map(elt=>elt.toDouble)</code></pre>

<p>What I want you to be careful here is...
	<ol>
		<li>The collection must be Vector</li>
		<li>you need to either declare type name of variable or insert "Double" in Vector[Int] such as "raw2" above</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>Ok, we could start to use Scalearn already. Create Data instance( if you need to make a set of Data, generate instance of "DataSet" class by giving parameters [ Data* ] )</p>

<pre><code>val Data1:Data = Data(raw1)
val Data2:Data = Vector(1,2,3,4,5).toda

val DataSet1:DataSet = DataSet(Data1,Data2,Data1)
val DataSet2:DataSet = new DataSet(Vector(Data1,Data2))
val DataSet3:DataSet = Vector(raw1,raw2,raw3).tods</code></pre>

<p>Get statistical value for Data1</p>

<pre><code>val mean:Double = Data1.mean

val standard_deviation:Double = Data1.sd

val length:Int = Data1.size

val deviation:Vector[Double] = Data1.dv

val axis_of_time:Vector[Double] = Data1.time

val regression_slope_intercept:(Double,Double) = Data1.reg

val regression_line:Double=>Double = Data1.regline

val residual:Data = Data1.resi</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps, you would worry about cost to create Data instance since it possesses a lot of properties; don't worry about it too much because scala initializes most of the properties when you require to use thanks to "lazy" keyword. Unless you call, it does't do anything to them. By the way, when you have to handle different kinds of Data, it's time to use "DataSet" class ( DataSet stands for Dataset )</p>

<pre><code>val mean:Vector[Double] = DataSet1.mean

val standard_deviation:Vector[Double] = DataSet1.sd

val combinations:Vector[Vector[Double]] = DataSet1.combi

val covariance:Vector[Double] = DataSet1.covar

val pearson_correlation:Vector[Double] = DataSet1.pears

val spearman_correlation:Vector[Double] = DataSet1.spears

val eucliean_distance:Vector[Double] = DataSet1.eucli

val regression_paremeters:Vector[(Double,Double)] = DataSet1.reg

val regression_line:Vector[Double=>Double] = DataSet1.regline</code></pre>

<p>Scalearn treats Data as a sample obtained from population and assume that we wanna know about population ( not sample Data itself ), so "sd" is estimated standard deviation of population or square root of unbiased variance ( If you are not familiar with statistics, don't worry about this and just ignore cuz it is actually tiny problem when sample size is big enough ).

<p>In the case wanna know about variance and standard deviation of sample itself</p>
<pre><code>val biased_variance = Data1.samplevari
val sample_standard_deviation = Data1.samplesd</code></pre>


<br>
<h4>#Statistical Inference</h4>
<br>

<p>Quite often, we have to distinguish whether the samples are taken from the same population or not; in other words, we should figure out the range of accidental error. Basically, "Datafactory" package offers you understandable tools so as to analyze statistically in almost same way; just use infds class ( meaningly, Dataset for statistical inference ).

<p>To begin with, let's make instance of infds. The infds class takes Data instances as parameters, so you need to create them first;
<br>alternatively, you could convert Vector [ Vector [ Double ] ] into infds instance implicitly</p>

<pre><code>val infer_Dataset1:infds = infds(Data1,Data2,Data3)

val infer_Dataset2:infds = Vector(raw1,raw2,raw3).toinf</code></pre>

<pre><code>val grand_mean :Double = infer_Dataset1.grandmean

val grand_size :Int = infer_Dataset1.grandsize

val grand_sum :Double = infer_Dataset1.grandsum

val effects :Vector[Double] = infer_Dataset1.effects

val tpair_vector :Vector[(Double,Boolean)] = infer_Dataset1.tpair

val twelch_vector :Vector[(Double,Boolean)] = infer_Dataset1.twelch

val anova_result :(Boolean,Double) = infer_Dataset1.anova</code></pre>



<br>
<h4>#Time Series Analysis</h4>
<br>
<ol>
	<li>Create instance of "TimeData" class ( stands for time series Data ) or "TimeDataSet" class ( stands for time series Dataset ). Either of them below is available.</li>
	<br>
	<pre><code>val ts1:TimeData = TimeData(1.0,2,3,4)
val ts2:TimeData = new TimeData(Vector(1.0,2,3,4,5))
val ts3:TimeData = Data1.ts

val tsds1:TimeDataset = TimeDataset(ts1,ts2,ts3)
val tsds2:TimeDataset = new TimeDataset(Vector(ts1,ts2,ts3))
val tsds3:TimeDataset = Dataset3.ts</code></pre>

	<pre><code>val detrended:TimeData = ts1.detrending
val differenced:TimeData = ts1.differencing
ts1.differencing.differencing.detrending</code></pre>

	<p>Since TimeData class inherits Data class, you can call properties and methods of Data class freely.
</ol>
